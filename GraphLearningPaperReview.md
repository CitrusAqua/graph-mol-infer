# Target
We aim to use graph models to get the prediction of molecure's features. Hoping to get better results than an usual RNN. This requires our graph model need to have relatively
powerful abilities to predict graph-level representations.

# Exsisted models

## Node embedding models
Node embedding model only has the ability to give node repressentations. Node embedding networks mostly deal with the unsupervised learning tasks, like node classification or
node clustering task.

## Generative graph models
Not suitable here. Different target tasks.

## Graph Neural Networks
Graph Neural Networks have abilities to tell graph-level features. Here GNN is the most suitable models.
